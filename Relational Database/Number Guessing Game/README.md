# World Cup Database Activity

âš½ Exploring World Cup Data

This README documents my experience with the World Cup Database activity in the Relational Databases curriculum. Let's dive into the exciting world of football data and how I interacted with the provided bash script.

## Introduction

The World Cup Database activity challenged me to work with a simulated database containing information about users, their gameplay, and their guesses in a number-guessing game. This activity allowed me to demonstrate my understanding of bash scripting and database interactions.

## Script Overview

The provided bash script is a self-contained program that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. It prompts the user to enter their username, checks if they are a returning user, and presents a number-guessing game. After the game, it stores the user's gameplay data in the database.

## Database Interaction

The script uses the `psql` command-line tool to execute SQL queries on the PostgreSQL database. It fetches information about the user, their gameplay statistics, and inserts new records into the users and games tables.

## Gameplay Experience

During the number-guessing game, the user attempts to guess a secret number between 1 and 1000. The script provides feedback on whether the guess is higher or lower than the secret number. After a successful guess, the script records the user's gameplay statistics, such as the number of guesses made.

## Real-World Application

Bash scripting and database interactions are essential skills for automating various tasks and processing data. This activity's script showcases how to interact with databases through a simple and user-friendly interface, which could be extended to more complex applications.

## Conclusion

Engaging with the World Cup Database activity was a hands-on journey through bash scripting and database manipulation. As an aspiring programmer, this experience equipped me with practical skills that can be applied to a wide range of projects, from data-driven applications to interactive command-line tools.
