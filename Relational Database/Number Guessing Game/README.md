# Number Guessing Activity

ðŸ”¢ Uncover the Secret Number

This README documents my experience with the Number Guessing activity in the Relational Databases curriculum. Let's dive into the intriguing world of guessing games and how I interacted with the provided bash script.

## Introduction

The Number Guessing activity challenged me to work with a simulated database where users play a number-guessing game. This activity provided hands-on experience in scripting, user interaction, and database management.

## Script Overview

The provided bash script creates a number-guessing game that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. It prompts the user for their username, checks their gaming history, and lets them play a guessing game. Afterward, it stores gameplay data in the database.

## Database Interaction

The script employs the `psql` command-line tool to execute SQL queries on the PostgreSQL database. It retrieves user information, gameplay statistics, and adds new records to the users and games tables.

## Gameplay Experience

During the number-guessing game, players attempt to guess a secret number between 1 and 1000. The script provides hints if the guess is higher or lower than the secret number. After a successful guess, the script records the player's gameplay data, including the number of guesses made.

## Real-World Application

Scripting, user interaction, and database management are essential skills for building interactive command-line applications. This activity's script serves as an example of how to combine these skills to create engaging games and applications that interact with databases.

## Conclusion

Engaging with the Number Guessing activity was a captivating journey through scripting, user engagement, and database integration. As an aspiring programmer, I gained practical skills that can be applied to a wide range of projects, from interactive games to data-driven applications.
