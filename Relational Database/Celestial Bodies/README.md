# Celestial Bodies Activity

üåå Exploring the Universe's Data

This README documents my experience with the Celestial Bodies activity in the Relational Databases curriculum. Let's dive into the fascinating world of celestial bodies and how I interacted with the provided database dump.

## Introduction

The Celestial Bodies activity provided me with a snapshot of a PostgreSQL database containing information about various celestial bodies, including galaxies, stars, planets, and moons. It was a hands-on opportunity to query and manipulate astronomical data, helping me sharpen my database skills.

## Database Contents

The database dump includes tables for galaxies, stars, planets, and moons. Each table is linked through foreign keys, creating relationships that mimic the natural connections between these celestial bodies. The schema showcases the rich complexity of our universe.

## Database Exploration

I interacted with the database using SQL queries to retrieve information about celestial bodies, their characteristics, and relationships. This experience deepened my understanding of SQL operations, JOINs, and data retrieval techniques.

## Real-World Application

Understanding databases is crucial not only for managing astronomical data but also for many real-world applications. Whether it's tracking scientific observations or organizing vast amounts of information, the skills learned in this activity have practical applications beyond the celestial realm.

## Conclusion

Exploring the Celestial Bodies activity was an eye-opening experience that bridged the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. As an aspiring programmer, I'm excited to apply these database skills to various domains and continue unraveling the mysteries of our universe.

Happy querying! üå†üîç
