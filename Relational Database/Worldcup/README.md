âš½ Exploring World Cup Data

This README documents my experience with the World Cup Database activity in the Relational Databases curriculum. Let's dive into the fascinating realm of World Cup statistics and how I interacted with the provided bash script.

## Introduction

The World Cup Database activity provided me with the opportunity to engage with a PostgreSQL database containing data about World Cup tournaments and teams. This activity allowed me to gain hands-on experience in querying databases and extracting valuable insights from the provided data.

## Script Overview

The provided bash script interacts with the World Cup database through the `psql` command-line tool. The script includes a set of predefined queries that extract useful information from the database. The output of each query is displayed along with a corresponding message.

## Database Interaction

The script utilizes the `psql` command-line tool to execute SQL queries on the PostgreSQL database. It retrieves information about goals, teams, rounds, and years from the World Cup games.

## Query Insights

The script's queries provide insights into various aspects of World Cup tournaments, such as total goals scored, average goals per game, winning teams, and specific rounds.

## Real-World Application

Working with databases and extracting meaningful information through SQL queries is a critical skill for data analysis and decision-making. This activity's script serves as an example of how to effectively use SQL to uncover insights from real-world datasets.

## Conclusion

Exploring the World Cup Database activity was an exhilarating journey into the world of World Cup statistics and database querying. As an aspiring data enthusiast, I gained practical skills that can be applied to various data analysis projects, from sports analytics to business intelligence.
