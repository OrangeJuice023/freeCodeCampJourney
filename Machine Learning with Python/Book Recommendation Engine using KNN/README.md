# Book Recommendation Engine using KNN - FreeCodeCamp Certification

## Description

The Book Recommendation Engine using KNN certification activity is an amazing project that challenges you to create a recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. In this project, I built a system that suggests books to users based on their reading history and preferences.

## Learning Experience

This project was a captivating journey into the world of recommendation systems and machine learning. I gained several key insights:

- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring data for accurate recommendations.
- K-Nearest Neighbors: Understanding and implementing the KNN algorithm for similarity-based recommendations.
- Feature engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the recommendation engine with real-world data.
- Practical application: Exploring how recommendation systems power platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and more.
