# Neural Network SMS Text Classifier - FreeCodeCamp Certification


## Description

The Neural Network SMS Text Classifier project is an exciting journey into the world of natural language processing and machine learning. In this project, I had the opportunity to create a neural network that can classify SMS text messages as either spam or non-spam.

## Learning Experience

Here's what I gained from this project:

- **Neural Networks:** I delved into the fundamentals of neural networks and how they can be used to tackle text classification tasks.
- **Preprocessing Text Data:** I learned how to preprocess and transform text data into a suitable format for neural network training.
- **Model Training:** I had the chance to train a neural network model to learn patterns from text data and make accurate predictions.
- **Model Evaluation:** I explored methods to evaluate the performance of the trained model and measure its accuracy.

## Benefits

Completing the Neural Network SMS Text Classifier certification was an eye-opening experience. It allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to a real-world problem and build a functional model. This project not only expanded my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of how neural networks can be applied to practical tasks.

I highly recommend this project to fellow learners who are interested in diving into natural language processing and neural networks. It's a fantastic opportunity to explore the power of machine learning in classifying text data.

Feel free to dive into this project, experiment with different architectures, and unleash your creativity. As an aspiring programmer, this certification is a significant milestone in mastering the world of machine learning and neural networks.

Happy coding and learning! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
