# Rock Paper Scissors Game - FreeCodeCamp Certification

## Introduction

Hello fellow programmers! As an aspiring coder, I'm excited to share my experience completing the Rock Paper Scissors certification activity at FreeCodeCamp.

## Description

The Rock Paper Scissors certification activity is a hands-on project that challenges you to create a simple game using JavaScript. In this project, I built a Rock Paper Scissors game where users can play against the computer. The game involves making choices between rock, paper, and scissors and determining the winner based on the classic rules.

## Learning Experience

This project taught me several key programming concepts:

- Using JavaScript to handle user interactions and computer-generated choices.
- Implementing conditional statements to determine the game outcome.
- Creating functions and variables to organize code and manage game logic.
- Incorporating user interface elements for a more interactive experience.

## Benefits

Completing the Rock Paper Scissors certification activity not only sharpened my programming skills but also boosted my confidence in building interactive web applications. It was a fun way to apply what I've learned and see immediate results.

By completing this project, I gained a solid understanding of JavaScript and its practical applications in creating simple games. It's a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn the basics of web development and programming.

I highly recommend the FreeCodeCamp Rock Paper Scissors certification activity to fellow learners. It's a rewarding experience that showcases your coding abilities and creativity while having fun!

Happy coding! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
