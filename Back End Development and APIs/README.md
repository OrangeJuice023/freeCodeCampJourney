# Back End Development and APIs Curriculum

As an aspiring programmer, I've dived into the Back End Development and APIs curriculum on FreeCodeCamp to deepen my understanding of server-side programming and building robust APIs. This curriculum covers essential topics that enable me to create dynamic web applications and connect them to databases, offering a complete perspective on full-stack development.

## Key Learnings from Projects

### Timestamp Microservice
I've built a Timestamp Microservice that converts Unix timestamps and natural language dates, enhancing my skills in creating APIs and handling date-time conversions.

### Request Header Parser Microservice
By creating a Request Header Parser Microservice, I've gained hands-on experience in extracting relevant information from incoming HTTP headers.

### URL Shortener Microservice
Building a URL Shortener Microservice has given me insights into creating APIs for URL shortening and redirection.

### Exercise Tracker
Through the Exercise Tracker project, I've honed my skills in designing APIs for tracking user exercises and workouts.

### File Metadata Microservice
Creating a File Metadata Microservice has expanded my knowledge of handling file uploads, managing metadata, and serving files through APIs.
