# File Metadata Microservice

## Introduction

This is a solution for the File Metadata Microservice project, part of the freeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs curriculum. The project involves creating an API that allows users to upload a file and retrieve its metadata.

## Project Description

The File Metadata Microservice project focuses on building a microservice using Express and multer to handle file uploads and provide metadata about the uploaded file. Users can upload a file, and the API will return the file's original name, type (MIME), and size.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- Express.js: A web application framework for building APIs and handling routes.
- Multer: A middleware for handling file uploads.
- CORS: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running: `npm install`.
4. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and set any environment variables if needed.
5. Start the server by running: `node index.js`.
6. Access the microservice by sending HTTP requests to the specified endpoints.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/fileanalyse`: Uploads a file and returns its metadata.
