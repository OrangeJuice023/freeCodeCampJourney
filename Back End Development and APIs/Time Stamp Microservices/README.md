# Timestamp Microservices Project

## Introduction

This is a solution for the Timestamp Microservices project, part of the freeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs curriculum. The project focuses on building a simple microservice that converts between date formats and Unix timestamps.

## Project Description

The Timestamp Microservices project aims to create a web service that can take a date input in either a natural language format or a Unix timestamp and return the corresponding UTC time and Unix timestamp. Users can provide a date in the URL, and the microservice will respond with the converted time data.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- Express.js: A web application framework for building APIs and handling routes.
- CORS: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
  
## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running: `npm install`.
4. Start the server by running: `node app.js`.
5. Access the microservice by opening your browser and navigating to: `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

1. `GET /api/:date`: Handles date conversion requests. Accepts a date in natural language or Unix timestamp format in the URL parameter `:date`. Responds with the converted UTC time and Unix timestamp.

2. `GET /api`: Provides the current UTC time and Unix timestamp.

## Future Improvements

The final implementation of this project may not exactly replicate the example. However, this solution serves as a starting point that can be improved and customized based on your requirements and preferences.

Feel free to explore and enhance this project further, adding features, error handling, and optimizations.
