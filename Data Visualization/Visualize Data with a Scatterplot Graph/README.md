# FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization Project: Scatter Plot


## About the Project

As an aspiring data visualizer, I'm thrilled to present my completed Scatter Plot project from the FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization curriculum. This project showcases my ability to create engaging and informative visualizations using D3.js, a popular JavaScript library for data visualization.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've designed a captivating scatter plot that effectively displays the correlation between two variables in a dataset. By leveraging the power of D3.js, I've transformed raw data into an interactive visualization that allows viewers to intuitively understand the patterns and trends within the data.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Data Presentation:** Through the integration of D3.js, I've developed a scatter plot that dynamically adapts to the provided dataset. This enables viewers to explore data points with ease.
- **Interactive Tooltips:** I've incorporated interactive tooltips that appear when users hover over data points. These tooltips provide additional context and information, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The scatter plot is responsive and can be seamlessly accessed across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience for all users.

## Project Showcase

This Scatter Plot project is a testament to my skills in data visualization, JavaScript programming, and user-centered design. By transforming complex data into a visually appealing and comprehensible format, I've successfully communicated insights and trends to a broader audience.
