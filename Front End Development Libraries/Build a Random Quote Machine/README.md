# Random Quote Machine

As an aspiring web developer, I've created a Random Quote Machine web application. This project allows users to view and share random quotes with friends and followers. The quotes are fetched from an external API, and users have the option to share the quotes on social media platforms like Twitter and Tumblr.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Styling defined in external stylesheets)
- JavaScript (Code logic)
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com) for social media icons
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for easier DOM manipulation

## Features

- Displays a random quote along with the author's name.
- Fetches quotes from the [Quotes API](https://type.fit/api/quotes).
- Allows users to request a new random quote by clicking the "New Quote" button.
- Provides options to share quotes on Twitter and Tumblr.
- Changes the background and button colors dynamically with each new quote.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. A random quote will be displayed along with the author's name.
3. Click the "New Quote" button to fetch a new random quote.
4. Click the Twitter icon to share the quote on Twitter.
5. Click the Tumblr icon to share the quote on Tumblr.

## Customization

- You can customize the visual appearance of the application by modifying the `styles.css` file.
- To change the font or font style, update the relevant sections in the `index.html` file.

## Acknowledgements

- This project uses the [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com) library for social media icons.
- Quotes are fetched from the [Quotes API](https://type.fit/api/quotes).
- The background color and button color change dynamically for a more engaging user experience.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication to allow users to save and favorite quotes.
- Add the ability for users to contribute their own quotes.
- Enhance the UI/UX with animations and transitions.

Feel free to explore and enhance this Random Quote Machine project. Happy coding!
