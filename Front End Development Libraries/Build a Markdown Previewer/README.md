# Build a Markdown Previewer

## Overview

The **Build a Markdown Previewer** activity is part of the Front End Development Libraries curriculum in FreeCodeCamp. This project involves creating a dynamic web application that allows users to write Markdown text and instantly visualize the rendered output. Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text in a simple and readable manner.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) library for converting Markdown to HTML
- Google Fonts for importing custom fonts

## Color Scheme

The color scheme for this project is inspired by the University of Santo Tomas (UST), featuring a combination of black and gold colors. The background color and text color are selected to reflect the UST theme, providing a visually appealing experience.

## Steps

1. **HTML Structure**: Set up the basic HTML structure to accommodate the editor and preview sections.

2. **CSS Styling**: Apply CSS styling to create an appealing and user-friendly interface, inspired by the UST color scheme.

3. **Default Content**: Provide a default Markdown content in the editor for demonstration.

4. **JavaScript Logic**: Implement JavaScript to update the previewer in real-time as the user types.

5. **Using Marked**: Integrate the `marked` library to convert Markdown into HTML for rendering.

6. **Event Handling**: Attach event listeners to detect content changes and trigger instant preview updates.

7. **Live Preview**: Allow users to observe immediate HTML-rendered results while editing Markdown.

## Learning Goals

- Apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts effectively.
- Utilize external libraries to enhance functionality and efficiency.
- Gain experience with the `marked` library for Markdown conversion.
- Practice event handling and dynamic DOM manipulation.
- Design an intuitive user interface for content rendering.

Completing this activity provides hands-on experience in building a Markdown Previewer, enhancing front-end development skills, and understanding real-time rendering in web applications.
