# Build a Drum Machine - FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Curriculum


## Overview

The "Build a Drum Machine" activity is part of the FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries curriculum. In this project, you will create an interactive drum machine web application using React. The drum machine will allow users to play drum sounds by clicking on drum pads or using keyboard keys.

## Features

- Interactive drum pads that play sounds when clicked or when corresponding keys are pressed.
- Display area showing the currently played drum pad key.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **useState and useEffect Hooks:** Used to manage component state and side effects.
- **HTML and CSS:** Structuring and styling the user interface.
- **Audio Element:** Used to play drum sounds.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the FreeCodeCamp curriculum repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to Project Folder:** Navigate to the project folder for the "Build a Drum Machine" activity.
3. **Setup:** Open the provided HTML file in your browser to see the basic layout.
4. **Modify CSS:** Customize the CSS styles to match the provided `styles.css` or create your own design.
5. **Implement React Component:** Replace the provided `script.js` code with the provided React code.
6. **Run the Application:** Open the HTML file in your browser to see the fully functional drum machine.
