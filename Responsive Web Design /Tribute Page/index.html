        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Napoleon Hill's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>October, 1883</strong> - Born in  Wise Country, Virginia</li>

         <li><strong>1908</strong> - Napoleon was working for a magazine by Bob Taylor's and was assigned to interview one of the most influential men of the time, Industrial giant Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie was the magnate of Pittsburg Steel, a billionaire - and during the interview he put a 20 year challenge to Napoleon, which he accepted and it changed his life.</li>
         <li><strong>1952</strong> - While Napoleon was lecturing in Chicago, after the 30's depression, he had no idea how much his book 'Think and Grow Rich,' had impacted the president of the Combined Insurance Company of America, until the president - Mr. W Clement Stone, began head-hunting him. Mr. Stone had been struggling through the years of the depression and at one point stumbled upon Napoleons book, and was so impressed with the work that he bought many copies for his sales staff. Having distributed the copies to all of them, he soon began amassing his fortune as the salespersons quickly rose in skills, and excelled in their achievements.</li>

          <li><strong>November 8, 1970</strong> - unknown cause of death.</li>
        </ul>

            "From a young, rebellious 'mountain reporter', with no family - to the founding granddad of 'the connection between success and the power of the mind' philosopher. He has been credited to have influenced the most people in all of history, in the genre of motivation and success. Not bad for someone who dropped out of law school, because he could no longer fund his own education."
