Learn Cartesian coordinates by building a scatterplot game. The Cartesian plane is the classic x-y coordinate grid (invented by Ren$\acute{e}$ DesCartes) where "<i>x</i>" is the horizontal axis and "<i>y</i>" is the vertical axis. Each (x,y) coordinate pair is a point on the graph. The point (0,0) is the "origin." The x value tells how much to move right (positive) or left (negative) from the origin. The y value tells you how much you move up (positive) or down (negative) from the origin. Notice that you are importing `matplotlib` to create the graph. The following code just displays one quadrant of the Cartesian graph. Just run this code to see how Python displays a graph.
