# Page View Time Series Visualizer

## Overview

Welcome to the **Page View Time Series Visualizer** project from the Data Analysis with Python curriculum at FreeCodeCamp. In this project, I will be working with time series data and data visualization to analyze and visualize page view statistics.

## Description

The **Page View Time Series Visualizer** project focuses on exploring and visualizing page view time series data. This project involves tasks such as:

- Cleaning and formatting the data to create a meaningful time series plot.
- Creating a line plot to display the number of page views over a specific period.
- Adding features like labeling, titles, and legends to enhance the clarity of the visualizations.
- Analyzing patterns, trends, and potential outliers in the time series data.

## Usage

1. Ensure the required libraries are installed: `pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn`
2. Run the script to generate the visualizations: `python script.py`
3. The generated time series plot will be displayed, allowing you to observe the page view trends.

## Learning Outcome

By completing this project, I will:

- Develop skills in handling and analyzing time series data.
- Gain experience in creating informative line plots to visualize trends over time.
- Learn how to use data visualization tools to convey insights and patterns effectively.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
