# Data Analysis with Python

As an aspiring programmer, I delved into the "Data Analysis with Python" curriculum on FreeCodeCamp to learn how to explore, clean, and visualize data using Python. This curriculum equipped me with essential skills to extract insights and make informed decisions from various datasets.

## Key Topics Covered

- **NumPy:** I learned how to use NumPy, a powerful library for numerical operations and array manipulation in Python.
- **Pandas:** I explored the Pandas library to work with DataFrames, manage data, and perform data manipulation tasks effectively.
- **Data Visualization:** Through Matplotlib and Seaborn, I discovered ways to create insightful visualizations, histograms, scatter plots, and more.
- **Data Cleaning:** I mastered techniques to identify and handle missing data, duplicate entries, and outliers.
- **Statistical Analysis:** I gained insights into basic statistics, correlation, and hypothesis testing, essential for drawing meaningful conclusions from data.
- **Time Series Analysis:** I learned about time-based data, date formatting, and time series visualization.

## Practical Projects

Throughout the curriculum, I tackled real-world projects that put my newfound skills to the test:

1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator:** I built a calculator to perform statistical calculations on financial data.
2. **Demographic Data Analyzer:** I analyzed demographic data using Pandas to extract valuable insights.
3. **Medical Data Visualizer:** I created visualizations to explore medical data, uncover trends, and answer critical questions.
4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer:** I utilized time series analysis to visualize website traffic trends.
5. **Sea Level Predictor:** Using linear regression, I predicted future sea levels based on historical data.
