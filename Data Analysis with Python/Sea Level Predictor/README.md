# Sea Level Predictor

## Overview

Welcome to the **Sea Level Predictor** project from the Data Analysis with Python curriculum at FreeCodeCamp. In this project, I will be working with sea level data and regression analysis to visualize and predict sea level trends.

## Description

The **Sea Level Predictor** project focuses on analyzing and predicting sea level rise based on historical data. This project involves the following tasks:

- Reading and loading sea level data from a CSV file.
- Creating a scatter plot of the sea level data and adding lines of best fit using linear regression.
- Visualizing sea level trends over time, including predictions for future years.
- Adding labels, title, and legend to enhance the clarity of the plot.

## Usage

1. Ensure the required libraries are installed: `pip install pandas matplotlib scipy`
2. Run the script to generate the sea level plot: `python script.py`
3. The generated plot will be displayed, showing historical and predicted sea level trends.

## Learning Outcome

By completing this project, I will:

- Gain experience in analyzing time series data and using regression analysis techniques.
- Learn how to create informative scatter plots with lines of best fit.
- Understand the concept of linear regression and its application in predicting future trends.
- Develop skills in data visualization and interpretation to convey insights effectively.


Happy coding! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
