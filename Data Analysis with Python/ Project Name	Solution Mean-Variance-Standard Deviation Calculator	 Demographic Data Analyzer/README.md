# Demographic Data Analyzer

## Overview

Welcome to the **Demographic Data Analyzer** activity from the Data Analysis with Python curriculum at FreeCodeCamp. In this project, you'll analyze demographic data using the pandas library in Python.

## Description

The **Demographic Data Analyzer** is a Python script that performs analysis on a given dataset (`adult.data.csv`). The script answers several questions related to demographic statistics:

- How many individuals belong to each race?
- What is the average age of men?
- What percentage of individuals have a Bachelor's degree?
- What percentage of individuals with advanced education make more than $50K?
- What percentage of individuals without advanced education make more than $50K?
- What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
- What percentage of people who work the minimum hours per week earn more than $50K?
- Which country has the highest percentage of individuals earning more than $50K?
- What is the most popular occupation for those who earn more than $50K in India?

## Usage

1. Ensure the `pandas` library is installed: `pip install pandas`
2. Run the script to perform demographic analysis on the provided dataset: `python script.py`
3. The script will print the calculated statistics to the console.

## Learning Outcome

By completing this activity, you will:

- Learn to use the `pandas` library for data analysis tasks.
- Gain practical experience in extracting insights from a dataset.
- Enhance your skills in working with dataframes and calculating statistics.
