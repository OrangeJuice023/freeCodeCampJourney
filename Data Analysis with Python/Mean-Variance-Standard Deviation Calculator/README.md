# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

## Overview

Welcome to the **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator** activity from the Data Analysis with Python curriculum at FreeCodeCamp. This project focuses on using Python's NumPy library to perform statistical calculations on a dataset.

## Description

The **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator** is a Python function called `calculate` that takes a list of nine numbers as input. It computes and organizes various statistics into a dictionary:

- **Mean:** Calculates mean along rows, columns, and overall mean of the dataset.
- **Variance:** Computes variance along rows, columns, and overall variance of the dataset.
- **Standard Deviation:** Determines standard deviation along rows, columns, and overall standard deviation.

## Usage

1. Provide a list of nine numbers as an argument to the `calculate` function.
2. Example: `result = calculate([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])`

## Learning Outcome

By completing this activity, you will:

- Learn to efficiently calculate statistics using Python's NumPy library.
- Gain practical experience in mean, variance, and standard deviation calculations.
- Enhance data analysis skills and coding proficiency.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
