# Medical Data Visualizer

## Overview

Welcome to the **Medical Data Visualizer** project from the Data Analysis with Python curriculum at FreeCodeCamp. In this project, you'll use data visualization libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `numpy` to visualize and analyze medical examination data.

## Description

The **Medical Data Visualizer** project focuses on visualizing medical examination data from the provided dataset (`medical_examination.csv`). This project involves creating two types of visualizations:

1. Categorical Plot: This visualization displays bar plots to compare the distribution of different categorical variables (e.g., cholesterol, glucose, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, overweight) based on whether individuals have cardiovascular disease or not.

2. Heat Map: This visualization showcases a heatmap of the correlation matrix of the medical examination data. It highlights correlations between key features like age, height, weight, systolic blood pressure (`ap_hi`), and diastolic blood pressure (`ap_lo`).

## Usage

1. Ensure the required libraries are installed: `pip install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn`
2. Run the script to generate the visualizations: `python script.py`
3. The visualizations will be saved as images (`catplot.png` and `heatmap.png`) in the current directory.

## Learning Outcome

By completing this project, you will:

- Gain experience in using data visualization libraries to create meaningful and informative visualizations.
- Learn to work with bar plots to compare categorical data and interpret correlations using heatmaps.
- Enhance your skills in data preprocessing, data analysis, and drawing insights from visualizations.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
