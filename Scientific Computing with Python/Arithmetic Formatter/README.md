# Arithmetic Formatter Project

## Overview

As part of the Scientific Computing with Python curriculum on FreeCodeCamp, I worked on the "Arithmetic Formatter" project. The project aimed to create a Python program that formats and arranges arithmetic problems in a visually appealing manner.

## Project Details

The primary goal of the project was to develop a program that takes a list of arithmetic problems and returns a formatted string. This string displays the problems vertically with proper alignment and spacing. The project required handling addition and subtraction problems, input validation, and proper arrangement of problems.

## Learning Focus

Through this project, I gained insights into the following key areas:

- **String Manipulation:** The project involved manipulating strings to achieve the desired formatting of arithmetic problems.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** I practiced performing basic addition and subtraction operations on numerical values.
- **Input Validation:** I learned how to validate input to ensure it adheres to specific rules and constraints.
- **Output Formatting:** I explored methods to format and align text output to create an organized visual presentation.

## Benefits and Skills Acquired

Completing the "Arithmetic Formatter" project provided the following benefits:

- **Enhanced Python Skills:** The project deepened my understanding of Python programming and its string manipulation capabilities.
- **Problem-Solving Practice:** I improved my ability to solve challenges related to input validation and output formatting.
- **Real-World Relevance:** The project emulated real-world scenarios where properly formatted output is essential for readability and comprehension.
